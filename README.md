# ErrorHandler

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mwat56/go-errorhandler?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mwat56/go-errorhandler)

## Purpose

The out-of-the-box `Go` web-server send _plain text error messages_ whenever an `HTTP` errror occurs. This package provides a simple facility to send whatever `HTML` page you like for error-pages.

## Installation

You can use `Go` to install this package for you:

    go get -u github.com/mwat56/go-errorhandler

## Usage

This package defines the `TErrorPager` interface which requires just one method:

    TErrorPager interface {
        // GetErrorPage returns an error page for `aStatus`.
        //
        // `aData` is the orignal error text.
        //
        // `aStatus` is the error number of the actual HTTP error.
        GetErrorPage(aData []byte, aStatus int) []byte
    }

If the method's return value is _empty_ then `aData` is sent _as is_ to the remote user, otherwise the method's result is sent thus delighting your users with your customised page.

Once you've implemented such a method you call the package's `Wrap()` function:

    Wrap(aHandler http.Handler, aPager TErrorPager) http.Handler

The arguments are:

* `aHandler` is your original HTTP handler which will be wrapped by this package (and used internally).

* `aPager` is the provider of error message pages as discussed above.

Additionally to the functionality discussed above the `http.Handler` returned by `Wrap()` catches (and logs to StdOut) any _panics_ that may have occured while serving the respective current request.

In the directory `_demo` there is the file `demo.go` which shows the bare minimum of how to integrate this package with your web-server.
